1.What is LinkedList? 
ANS :
	- LinkedList is a class in Java Collection Framework that implements the List interface.
	- It stores elements in nodes.
	Each node contains:
	- Data
	- Address of next node (and previous node in doubly linked list)
	- It allows duplicate elements.
	- It maintains insertion order.
	- Insertion and deletion are faster than ArrayList.
	- It belongs to java.util package.
	
2 Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList. 
ANS :
	Data Structure Used
	- ArrayList is based on a dynamic array, whereas LinkedList is based on a doubly linked list.
	
	Memory Allocation
	- ArrayList uses contiguous memory locations, while LinkedList uses non-contiguous memory locations.
	
	Insertion and Deletion
	- In ArrayList, insertion and deletion are slow because elements need to be shifted.
	- In LinkedList, insertion and deletion are faster because no shifting is required.
	
	Accessing Elements
	- ArrayList provides fast random access using index numbers.
	- LinkedList does not provide fast random access and requires traversal.
	
	Memory Usage
	- ArrayList consumes less memory.
	- LinkedList consumes more memory because it stores additional pointer references.
	
3 What is a HashSet? 
ANS :
	- HashSet is a class that implements the Set interface.
	- It does not allow duplicate elements.
	- It does not maintain insertion order.
	- It stores elements using a hashing mechanism.
	- Allows only one null value.
	- It is best when you want unique elements. 
	
4 What is LinkedHashSet?
ANS :
	- LinkedHashSet is a subclass of HashSet.
	- Does not allow duplicates.
	- Maintains insertion order.
	
	Internally uses:
	- Hash table
	- Doubly linked list
	
	Difference from HashSet:
	- HashSet → No order
	- LinkedHashSet → Maintains insertion order
5 What is TreeSet?
ANS :
	- TreeSet is a class that implements the Set interface.
	- Does not allow duplicate elements.
	- Stores elements in sorted order.
	- Uses Red-Black Tree internally.
	- Does not allow null values (in most cases).
	Sorting is done by:
	- Natural ordering
	- Comparator
	- Best used when you need unique + sorted data.
