1. What is Java and why is it platform-independent?

ANS : Java is a high level,object-oriented programming langugae developed by sun microsystem in 1997 
	  and it is used to develop  
	  desktop applications,web application and high enterprise-;l system beacuse it is 
	  secure and plateform independent  : Java is platform-independent because it runs on the JVM, 
	  not directly on the operating system. So the same Java program can run on any system.
	  (Write Once, Run Anywhere.)
	  
2. Explain the features of Java.

ANS :  1. Simple Syntax : 
          Java syntax is very straightforward and very easy to learn. 
       2. Object Oriented
		  Java is a pure object-oriented language. It supports core OOP concepts like,

			1.Class
			2.Objects
			3.Inheritance
			4.Encapsulation
			5.Abstraction
			6.Polymorphism
			
 	   3. Platform-Independent :
 	   	  Runs on any system using JVM (Write Once, Run Anywhere).

       4. Secure :
          Protects data using security features like JVM and no pointers.

       5. Robust :
          Strong memory management and error handling.

       6. Portable :
       	  Java programs can move from one system to another easily.

       7. Multithreaded :
       	  Can perform multiple tasks at the same time.
       	  
3. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?

ANS :  JVM (Java Virtual Machine) runs the Java bytecode and makes Java platform-independent.
       JRE (Java Runtime Environment) provides JVM and libraries required to run Java programs.
       JDK (Java Development Kit) is used to develop Java programs and includes JRE and development tools like the compiler.
       
       VM	Executes bytecode
       JRE	Runs Java programs
       JDK	Develops Java programs
       
4.What is bytecode in Java?  
ANS :
		Bytecode in Java is an intermediate code generated when a Java program is 
		compiled. 
		When you write Java code, it is saved as a .java file. 
		After compilation, it becomes a .class file. 
		This .class file contains bytecode. 
		Bytecode is not machine-specific. 
		It can run on any operating system that has a JVM. 
		JVM reads the bytecode and converts it into machine code. 
		
5.Explain the concept of object-oriented programming.
ANS :   
		Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs by treating 
		everything as objects.  
		Each object has data and methods that work on that data. 
		OOP helps make code easy to understand, reuse, and manage  
		by using concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and 
		abstraction. 
		1.Encapsulation (Data Hiding) 
		Wrapping data and methods together and protecting data from outside 
		access. 
		2.Inheritance (Reusability) 
		One class inherits properties and methods of another class. 
		3.Polymorphism (Many Forms) 
		Same method name, different behavior. 
		4.Abstraction (Hiding Implementation) 
		Showing what an object does, not how it does.
