What is abstraction in Java? 
ANS :
	- Abstraction means we know what to do, but we don’t know how it is done inside.
	- It means hiding internal details and showing only important things.
	- We can achieve abstraction using:
		Abstract class
		Interface
	- What happens in Abstraction?
		We hide the logic inside methods.
		The user only sees the method name.
		Implementation details are hidden.
		
2 What is an abstract class? 
ANS : 
	- An abstract class is a class declared with abstract keyword.
	- It can have abstract methods (without body) and normal methods (with body).
	- We cannot create object of abstract class.
	- It is used when we want common features but implementation will be given by child class.
	
3 What is an interface in Java? 
ANS: 
	- Interface is used to achieve 100% abstraction.
	- It contains only abstract methods and constants.
	- We use implements keyword to use interface.
	- A class can implement multiple interfaces.
	
4 Difference between abstract class and interface.
ANS: 
	- Abstract class can have normal + abstract methods, interface mostly has only abstract methods.
	- Abstract class uses extends, interface uses implements.
	- We cannot create object of both.
	- A class can extend only one abstract class.
	- A class can implement multiple interfaces.
5 What is a constructor? 
ANS :
	- Constructor is a special method used to initialize object.
	- It has same name as class name.
	- It is automatically called when object is created.
	- It is used to assign values to variables.
